# Scream Jam 24

This game jam, although with little progress, clearly displayed the amount of preplanning and preparation required to develop a well thought out game. This includes developing a knowledge of the techniques and skills to produce a game beforehand.
Discipline and time was very scarce when brainstorming and developing ideas, before even getting into the engine. This experience, although short taught a lesson of preparation.

## Aftermath

This repo will now be in use to test the ideas and still reap from this experience, learning and allowing this project to bear some fruit.
